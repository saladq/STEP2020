        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio! </h3>

        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sara Qu, a rising junior at Harvard concentrating 
            in Computer Science. On campus I am mainly involved in AADT (Asian American 
            Dance Troup), Breakers, and The Crimson as a web and print designer. In my 
            spare time, I like to swim and bake. My home is based in New York City where 
            I frequently go into the city to catch up with friends over a meal or by 
            meandering around.
        </p>
