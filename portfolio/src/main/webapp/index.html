        <h3>Welcome to my portfolio! </h3>

        <div id="aboutme"><h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sara Qu, a rising junior at Harvard concentrating 
            in Computer Science. I declared my concentration the fall of 2019 and since the start of 
            college, I have taken classes in functional programming, theoretical CS, and data 
            structure and algorithms. I am looking forward to taking more classes in the upcoming 
            years, perhaps courses in design or artificial intelligence. </p>
        <p> On campus I am mainly involved in AADT (Asian American 
            Dance Troup), Breakers, and The Crimson as a web and print designer. In my 
            spare time, I like to swim and bake. My home is based in New York City where 
            I frequently go into the city to catch up with friends over meals or by 
            meandering around.

        <div id="hobbies"><h2> Hobbies </h2>
            <p>I love swimming, playing volleyball, and playing badminton. I also love doing 
                a lot of small artworks on the side whenever I have free time. These tend to 
                be pretty unconventional. I like making pottery, crocheting and baking. And 
                among these interests, I probably like baking the most, specifically bread and 
                cakes. I gained an interest in baking the winter of 2018-2019. There really
                is nothing like the satisfaction of kneading dough to a smooth, milky 
                complexion and of eating a whole-days-effort three layer cake topped with 
                tons of whipped cream and fruits.
